## Hello, World! 🤗

💻 My name is Liz and I'm currently transitioning my career, exploring the world of UI/UX and Product Design, with a stronger focus on UX.

I have experience developing apps for the Apple ecosystem (iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS), as well as working with C, Embedded C, industrial approaches, and Electronics.

🤖 A STEM enthusiast, I am also passionate about Educational Robotics and act as a volunteer judge at FIRST LEGO League tournaments.
